2. **Initialized Project**: Run `node snapshot.js init` in your project to create the snapshots system
3. **VS Code**: Version 1.74.0 or higher

## Installation

### Method 1: Package the Extension (Recommended)
1. Install `vsce` globally: `npm install -g vsce`
2. Navigate to the extension directory: `cd vscode-extension`
3. Package the extension: `vsce package`
4. Install the generated `.vsix` file in VS Code: Extensions ‚Üí Install from VSIX

## Architecture

This extension follows the "smart wrapper" principle:
- **No business logic**: All operations delegate to the CLI tool
- **Pure UI layer**: Handles user interaction and file management only
- **CLI integration**: Executes `node snapshot.js` commands via child processes
